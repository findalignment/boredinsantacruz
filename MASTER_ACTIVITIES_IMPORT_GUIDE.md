## üì• Step 3: Import to Airtable

### Create the New Table:

1. **Open your Airtable base**
2. **Create a new table** called `Activities`
3. **Delete the default fields** (Name, Notes, etc.)

### Import the CSV:

#### Method A: Import via Airtable Interface
1. Click the **dropdown arrow** next to the table name
2. Select **"Import data"** ‚Üí **"CSV file"**
3. Upload `master-activities-import.csv`
4. Map the fields (Airtable should auto-detect)
5. Click **"Import"**

#### Method B: Copy-Paste (if import doesn't work)
1. Open the CSV in Excel/Google Sheets
2. Select all data (including headers)
3. Copy (Cmd/Ctrl + C)
4. In Airtable, create fields matching the headers
5. Paste into the table

### Fix Field Types:

After import, set the correct field types:

| Field | Type |
|-------|------|
| ID | Single line text |
| Name | Single line text |
| Description | Long text |
| WriteUp | Long text |
| Category | Single select |
| Cost | Number |
| IndoorOutdoor | Single select |
| PhotoURL | URL |
| Latitude, Longitude | Number (decimal) |
| Hours | Long text |
| Phone | Phone number |
| Website, Instagram | URL |
| Tags | Multiple select (or text) |

| KidFriendly, PetFriendly | Checkbox |
| RainOk, WindSensitive, etc. | Checkbox |
| Rating | Number (decimal) |
| StaffPick, Featured, Sponsored | Checkbox |
| Status | Single select |

---

## üîß Step 4: Update Environment Variables

Once the table is imported, update your `.env.local`:

```bash
# Master Activities Table (replaces all separate activity tables)
AIRTABLE_ACTIVITIES_TABLE=Activities

# You can keep these for backwards compatibility, or remove them:
# AIRTABLE_RAINY_TABLE=RainyActivities  # Optional - keep if you want legacy support
# AIRTABLE_SUNNY_TABLE=SunnyActivities  # Optional - keep if you want legacy support
```

---

## üöÄ Step 5: Code Migration (I'll do this for you!)

Once you confirm the table is set up, I'll update the following files:

### Files I'll Modify:

1. **`src/lib/airtable.ts`**
   - Add `activities` table reference
   - Keep old tables for backwards compatibility (optional)

2. **`src/app/actions/getActivities.ts`**
   - Update to fetch from new `Activities` table
   - Support filtering by weather, category, indoor/outdoor
   - Add new `getMasterActivities()` function

3. **`src/types/index.ts`**
   - Create new `Activity` interface with all 50+ fields
   - Keep `RainyActivity` for backwards compatibility

4. **`src/app/activities/page.tsx`**
   - Update to use new master table
   - Add category filters

5. **`src/app/rainy/page.tsx`**
   - Update to filter master table by `RainOk = true`
   - Or keep using old table if you prefer

6. **`src/app/sunny/page.tsx`**
   - Update to filter master table by weather preferences

7. **`src/lib/recommendations/engine.ts`**
   - Update to use master table
   - Enhanced weather-based filtering

8. **`src/components/filtered-activities.tsx`**
   - Update to support new fields

### New Features I'll Add:

- ‚úÖ **Weather-based filtering** (rainy, sunny, foggy, etc.)
- ‚úÖ **Category filtering** (beaches, hiking, museums, etc.)
- ‚úÖ **Indoor/Outdoor filtering**
- ‚úÖ **Cost-based filtering**
- ‚úÖ **Kid-friendly filtering**
- ‚úÖ **Pet-friendly filtering**
- ‚úÖ **Enhanced recommendation engine**

---

## üìä Step 6: Testing Plan

After I update the code, test these pages:

1. **`/activities`** - Should show all activities from master table
2. **`/rainy`** - Should filter to RainOk = true activities
3. **`/sunny`** - Should filter to sunny weather activities
4. **`/activity/[id]`** - Detail pages should still work
5. **Homepage** - Recommendations should use new table
6. **Search** - Should search all activities

## ‚úÖ Quick Start Checklist

- [ ] Optional: Edit WriteUp, Tips, Parking for your favorites
- [ ] Import CSV to Airtable as new "Activities" table
- [ ] Fix field types (checkboxes, selects, numbers)
- [ ] Add `AIRTABLE_ACTIVITIES_TABLE=Activities` to `.env.local`

## üí° Pro Tips

1. **Start small** - Import the CSV as-is, test it, then add WriteUps later
2. **Test the import** - Create a test base first if you're nervous
3. **Keep old tables** - Don't delete RainyActivities/SunnyActivities yet
4. **Add gradually** - You can import 33 activities now, add more later
5. **Mark favorites** - Set StaffPick = true for your top 10

```
ID: natural-bridges-state-beach

Description: Iconic beach featuring a natural rock bridge, tide pools, monarch butterfly grove, and stunning sunset views.
WriteUp: We've been visiting Natural Bridges for years, and it never gets old. The tide pools at low tide are incredible - you'll see sea stars, anemones, and hermit crabs. Kids love exploring, just remind them to look but not touch! The butterfly grove (Oct-Feb) is absolutely magical with thousands of monarchs. Go on a sunny morning for the best experience. The beach itself is perfect for sunset, but view the bridge from the western side. Don't forget layers - the wind picks up in the afternoon!

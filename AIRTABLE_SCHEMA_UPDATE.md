## ‚úÖ Validation Checklist

Before you're done, verify:

- [ ] All activities have at least 1 WeatherSuitability option
- [ ] IdealTemp_Min is always ‚â§ IdealTemp_Max
- [ ] Indoor activities have wide temp ranges (0-150)
- [ ] Outdoor activities have realistic temp ranges
- [ ] WeatherBoost values are between 0.5 and 2.0
- [ ] Indoor activities have RainOk checked
- [ ] Outdoor scenic activities have RequiresGoodVisibility checked

---

## üìä Expected Results

After this update:
- **Indoor activities**: Should score high on rainy/cold days
- **Outdoor activities**: Should score high on nice days
- **Mixed activities**: Should have moderate scores across conditions
- **Boosted activities**: Should rise to the top in their ideal conditions

---

## üí° Pro Tips

1. **Be generous with WeatherSuitability**: Select all conditions where the activity is reasonably enjoyable

2. **Use WeatherBoost strategically**: 
   - 1.5-2.0: Perfect for this weather (ice cream on hot day)
   - 1.2-1.4: Extra appealing (museum on rainy day)
   - 1.0: Neutral
   - 0.7-0.9: Less appealing (beach on cold day)

3. **Temperature ranges**: 
   - Indoor: Very wide (0-150)
   - Outdoor active: 55-85
   - Beach/water: 70-90
   - Cold weather activities: 40-70

4. **Test as you go**: After updating 5-10 activities, test the recommendations to see if they make sense

## üîÑ How to Update Existing Activities

1. Open your Airtable base
2. Go to RainyActivities table
3. Click the ‚äï button to add a field (or click on existing field header)
4. Add each new field one by one

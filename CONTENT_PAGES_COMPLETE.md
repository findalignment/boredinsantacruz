## ✍️ WriteUp Field - The Game Changer

### What is WriteUp?
A **long-form editorial content field** (300-800 words) that's separate from the short description.

### WriteUp vs Description

| Field | Length | Use | Where It Shows |
|-------|--------|-----|----------------|
| **Description** | 50-150 words | Quick summary, facts | Cards, lists, search results |
| **WriteUp** | 300-800 words | Storytelling, insider knowledge, editorial voice | Detail pages only, in "Our Take" section |

### WriteUp Example

**Description (for card):**
> "Iconic beach featuring a natural rock bridge, tide pools, monarch butterfly grove, and stunning sunset views. Perfect for families and photographers."

**WriteUp (for detail page):**
> "We've been visiting Natural Bridges for years, and it never gets old. The tide pools are incredible at low tide - you'll see sea stars, anemones, and hermit crabs. Kids love exploring the rocks, just remind them to look but not touch!
>
> The butterfly grove is open from October through February, and it's absolutely magical. Thousands of monarch butterflies cluster in the eucalyptus trees. Go on a sunny morning for the best experience - they're most active when it's warm.
>
> Parking is $10 and the lot fills up fast on sunny weekends. Arrive before 10am or try street parking on the residential streets nearby. The beach itself is gorgeous for sunset, but the natural bridge is best viewed from the western side of the beach. Don't forget to bring layers - the wind can pick up in the afternoon!"

# ✅ Master Activities Table Migration - COMPLETE!

## 🎉 Status: READY TO USE

Your website is now using the **master Activities table** from Airtable! The migration is complete and backwards compatible.

---

## ✅ What's Been Done

### 1. **Infrastructure** ✅
- ✅ Added `activities` table reference to `src/lib/airtable.ts`
- ✅ Created comprehensive `Activity` type with 50+ fields in `src/types/index.ts`
- ✅ Created `getMasterActivities` action with advanced filtering
- ✅ Kept legacy tables for backwards compatibility

### 2. **Pages Updated** ✅
- ✅ `/rainy` - Now filters master table by `RainOk = true`
- ✅ `/sunny` - Now filters master table by `WeatherPreferences = 'sunny'`
- ✅ Both pages fallback to legacy tables if master table empty

### 3. **Components Updated** ✅
- ✅ `FilteredActivities` - Supports both legacy and new Activity types
- ✅ `ActivityCard` - Works with new fields

---

## 🚀 How It Works Now

### Filtering System

Your master Activities table supports powerful filtering:

```typescript
// Get rainy day activities
getRainyActivities() // Filters by RainOk = true

// Get sunny day activities
getSunnyActivities() // Filters by WeatherPreferences contains 'sunny'

// Get by category
getActivitiesByCategory('Beach') // All beaches
getActivitiesByCategory('Hiking') // All hiking trails

// Get by indoor/outdoor
getIndoorActivities() // IndoorOutdoor = 'Indoor'
getOutdoorActivities() // IndoorOutdoor = 'Outdoor'

// Get kid-friendly
getKidFriendlyActivities() // KidFriendly = true

// Get staff picks
getStaffPicks() // StaffPick = true

// Custom filtering
getMasterActivities({
  category: 'Beach',
  rainOk: false,
  maxCost: 20,
  kidFriendly: true,
})
```

### Data Flow

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### "No activities found" on /rainy or /sunny

**Fix:** In Airtable, make sure:
- For rainy: Set `RainOk = TRUE` on indoor activities
- For sunny: Add 'sunny' to `WeatherPreferences` field

### "Activities table not configured" error

**Cause:** Environment variable not set  
**Fix:** Add to `.env.local`:
```
AIRTABLE_ACTIVITIES_TABLE=Activities
```

### Activities not updating

**Cause:** Cache (1 hour)  
**Fix:** Wait up to 1 hour, or restart dev server

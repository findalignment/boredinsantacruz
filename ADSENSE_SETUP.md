## 🎯 How to Add Ads to Specific Pages

### Option 1: Automatic Auto Ads (Easiest)
Google AdSense will automatically place ads on pages where the script is loaded.

**Already enabled!** Just go to your AdSense dashboard:
1. **Ads** → **By site** → Your site
2. Enable **Auto ads**
3. Choose ad types and placements
4. Save

### Option 2: Manual Ad Placements (More Control)

If you want to manually place ads in specific locations:

#### Get Your Ad Slot IDs:
1. Go to [AdSense Dashboard](https://www.google.com/adsense/)
2. **Ads** → **By ad unit** → **Display ads**
3. Create new ad units and copy the slot IDs

#### Example: Add ad to activity page

```tsx
import { DisplayAd } from '@/components/ads/display-ad';

// In your component:
<DisplayAd 
  slot="1234567890" 
  format="auto"
  responsive={true}
/>
```

#### Example: Add in-article ad

```tsx
import { InArticleAd } from '@/components/ads/in-article-ad';

// In your component:
<InArticleAd slot="1234567890" />
```

Best performing ad locations:

## 📈 Monitoring Performance

### Check AdSense Dashboard
1. **Home** → Overview of earnings
2. **Reports** → Detailed performance
3. **Optimization** → Suggestions from Google

### Key Metrics to Watch
- **RPM** (Revenue per 1000 impressions)
- **CTR** (Click-through rate)
- **Viewability** (% of ads actually seen)

---

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### "Ads not showing"
**Wait 24-48 hours after deployment:**
- Google needs to approve your site
- Ads won't show until approved

**Check AdSense dashboard:**
- Is your site approved?
- Are auto ads enabled?
- Any policy violations?

### "Blank spaces where ads should be"
- Ad blockers will hide ads (normal)
- Some users have ad blockers installed
- Ads may not fill 100% of the time

### "ads.txt warnings in AdSense"
- Make sure `public/ads.txt` exists
- Verify it's accessible at: `yoursite.com/ads.txt`
- Redeploy if needed

## 🎨 Styling Ads

Ads are wrapped in containers you can style:

```css
.adsense-container {
  margin: 2rem 0;
  padding: 1rem;
  background: #f9f9f9;
  border-radius: 8px;
}
```

Or use Tailwind classes in the component:
```tsx
<DisplayAd 
  slot="123" 
  className="my-8 p-4 bg-gray-50 rounded-lg"
/>
```

# üìù Content Management Guide - Writeups & Images

## Part 1: Restaurant Writeups

### Best Approach: Use Airtable Fields

You have **two options** for adding restaurant writeups:

---

### Option A: Use Existing "Description" Field (Recommended)

**Pros:**
- ‚úÖ Field already exists in Airtable
- ‚úÖ Website already reads this field
- ‚úÖ No code changes needed
- ‚úÖ Displays on restaurant detail pages

**How to Add:**
1. Open your Airtable `Restaurants` table
2. Find (or create) the `Description` column (Long Text field)
3. Write your restaurant descriptions:

```
Example for "The Crow's Nest":
Waterfront restaurant and bar with stunning harbor views. Known for 
fresh seafood, live music on weekends, and unbeatable sunset dining. 
The clam chowder is a local favorite, and the fish tacos are made 
with daily catches. Great happy hour 3-6pm daily with $2 off appetizers 
and drinks. Reservations recommended for dinner, especially Friday/Saturday.
```

**What the Website Shows:**
- Restaurant list page: First 150 characters
- Restaurant detail page: Full description
- Search results: Excerpt with highlighting

---

### Option B: Add Custom "WriteUp" Field

**Pros:**
- ‚úÖ Separate from short description
- ‚úÖ Can have longer, editorial content
- ‚úÖ Better for SEO (more content)

**Cons:**
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Requires code update to display

**How to Implement:**

#### Step 1: Add Field in Airtable
1. Open `Restaurants` table
2. Add new column: `WriteUp` (Long Text)
3. Add your editorial content:

```
Example WriteUp:
=============
THE INSIDER'S TAKE

The Crow's Nest has been a Santa Cruz institution since 1969. 
Perched right on the harbor, it offers some of the best views in 
town ‚Äì especially from the upstairs dining room at sunset.

WHAT TO ORDER:
‚Ä¢ Clam Chowder (local favorite, gets crowded at lunch)
‚Ä¢ Fish Tacos (made with daily catch, ask what's fresh)
‚Ä¢ Blackened Salmon (perfectly seasoned, comes with seasonal veggies)
‚Ä¢ Harbor Burger (not seafood, but secretly the best burger in town)

INSIDER TIPS:
- Arrive 30 min before sunset for window seats
- Happy hour 3-6pm = best value (half-price appetizers)
- Downstairs bar is more casual, upstairs is date-night vibes
- Live music most weekends (check schedule online)
- Free parking, but can fill up ‚Äì arrive early on weekends

BEST FOR:
Sunset dinner, date night, seafood lovers, live music, happy hour

AVOID IF:
You're in a rush (service can be slow when busy)
```

#### Step 2: Update Website Code
I can add this if you want ‚Äì it would display the WriteUp on detail pages below the main description.

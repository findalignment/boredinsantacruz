## Common Issues & Solutions

### ‚ùå Issue 1: "Nothing happened" when submitting

**Possible Causes:**

**A) Environment Variables Not Set**
```bash
# Check your .env.local has all these:
AIRTABLE_TOKEN="pat...."
AIRTABLE_BASE_ID="app..."
AIRTABLE_EVENTS_TABLE="Events"
RESEND_API_KEY="re_..."
EMAIL_FROM="events@boredinsantacruz.com"
ADMIN_EMAIL="your-email@example.com"
```

**B) Development Server Not Restarted**
After adding environment variables, you MUST restart:
```bash
# Stop the server (Ctrl+C)
npm run dev
```

**C) Wrong Table Name**
- Check your Airtable table is named exactly: `Events`
- Or update `AIRTABLE_EVENTS_TABLE` to match your table name

**D) Missing Airtable Fields**
Your Airtable table must have these fields (case-sensitive):
- Title (Single line text)
- Description (Long text)
- Categories (Single line text)
- Start Date (Date)
- Start Time (Single line text)
- Venue Name (Single line text)
- Venue Address (Single line text)
- Is Online (Checkbox)
- Cost (Single line text)
- Ticket URL (URL)
- Website URL (URL)
- Contact Email (Email)
- Contact Phone (Phone number)
- Image URL (URL)
- Video URL (URL)
- Kid Friendly (Checkbox)
- Pet Friendly (Checkbox)
- Accessible (Checkbox)
- Age Restriction (Single line text)
- Submitter Name (Single line text)
- Submitter Email (Email)
- Status (Single select: "Pending Review", "Approved", "Rejected")
- Submitted Date (Date)

### ‚ùå Issue 2: "Event appears in Airtable but no email"

**Possible Causes:**

**A) Resend Domain Not Verified**
1. Go to [resend.com/domains](https://resend.com/domains)
2. Check if `boredinsantacruz.com` shows "Verified" status
3. If not, check your DNS records (takes 15-30 min)

**B) Wrong EMAIL_FROM Domain**
Your `EMAIL_FROM` must match a verified domain in Resend:
```bash
# Good (if you verified this domain):
EMAIL_FROM="events@boredinsantacruz.com"

# Bad (unverified domain):
EMAIL_FROM="test@gmail.com"
```

**C) Email in Spam Folder**
- Check your spam/junk folder
- Check Resend dashboard for delivery logs

**D) Resend API Key Invalid**
- Get a fresh key from [resend.com/api-keys](https://resend.com/api-keys)
- Make sure it starts with `re_`

### ‚ùå Issue 3: Form shows error message

**Check Browser Console:**
1. Open your browser's Developer Tools (F12)
2. Go to "Console" tab
3. Submit the form again
4. Look for red error messages
5. Share the error with me if you need help

**Check Network Tab:**
1. Open Developer Tools (F12)
2. Go to "Network" tab
3. Submit the form
4. Look for a request to `/api/events/submit`
5. Click it and check the "Response" tab
6. This shows the exact error from the server

## Step-by-Step Verification

### ‚úÖ Step 1: Verify Airtable Setup

**Test Airtable Connection:**
```bash
# Replace with your actual values:
AIRTABLE_TOKEN="pat...."
AIRTABLE_BASE_ID="app..."

curl -X GET "https://api.airtable.com/v0/$AIRTABLE_BASE_ID/Events?maxRecords=1" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $AIRTABLE_TOKEN"
```

**Expected Response:**
- Status 200 OK
- JSON with `records` array

**If it fails:**
- Check your token is correct
- Check your base ID is correct
- Check the table name is "Events" (case-sensitive)

---

### ‚úÖ Step 2: Verify Resend Setup

**Test Resend API:**
```bash
# Replace with your actual key:
RESEND_API_KEY="re_..."

curl -X GET "https://api.resend.com/domains" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $RESEND_API_KEY"
```

**Expected Response:**
- Status 200 OK
- List of domains with status

**If it fails:**
- Check your API key is correct
- Generate a new key if needed

---

### ‚úÖ Step 3: Test Event Submission (Manual)

**Submit a Test Event via API:**

1. Make sure your dev server is running:
```bash
npm run dev
```

2. Open a new terminal and run:
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/events/submit \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "title": "Test Event",
    "description": "This is a test event to verify the system works",
    "categories": "Music",
    "startDate": "2025-11-01",
    "startTime": "18:00",
    "endDate": "",
    "endTime": "",
    "venueName": "The Catalyst",
    "venueAddress": "1011 Pacific Ave, Santa Cruz, CA 95060",
    "venueCity": "Santa Cruz",
    "isOnline": false,
    "onlineUrl": "",
    "cost": "$",
    "ticketUrl": "",
    "websiteUrl": "",
    "contactEmail": "",
    "contactPhone": "",
    "imageUrl": "",
    "videoUrl": "",
    "kidFriendly": false,
    "petFriendly": false,
    "accessible": true,
    "ageRestriction": "All ages",
    "submitterName": "Test User",
    "submitterEmail": "test@example.com"
  }'
```

**Expected Response:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Event submitted successfully",
  "eventId": "rec..."
}
```

**If successful:**
1. Check Airtable - record should appear
2. Check email - confirmation should arrive
3. Your system is working! ‚úÖ

**If it fails:**
- Check the error message
- Verify all environment variables
- Check server logs in terminal

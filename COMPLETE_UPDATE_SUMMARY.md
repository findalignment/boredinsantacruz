## 📍 Where Are The Pages?

### Deals Page:
**URL:** `/deals`  
**File:** `src/app/deals/page.tsx`  
**Status:** ✅ Live and ready

Shows:
- Happy hour specials
- Daily deals
- Filter by day of week, area, deal type
- Will integrate with Airtable `Deals` table

### Wellness Page:
**URL:** `/wellness`  
**File:** `src/app/wellness/page.tsx`  
**Status:** ✅ Live and ready

Shows:
- Yoga studios
- Fitness centers
- Massage & spa
- Wellness activities
- Will integrate with Airtable `Wellness` table

**Both pages are accessible from:**
1. Top navigation (desktop)
2. Hamburger menu (all devices)
3. Direct URL

---

## 🔒 Profile Page Security

**Current Status:**
The profile page (`/profile`) **IS protected**. Here's what happens:

1. **Not logged in:** Automatically redirected to `/login`
2. **Logged in:** Shows personalized profile with:
   - Your name, email, profile photo
   - Your favorites count
   - Your reviews
   - Your trips (coming soon)

**Code protection:**
```typescript
const session = await auth();
if (!session) {
  redirect('/login');  // Blocks unauthenticated access
}
```

**Middleware protection:**
`src/middleware.ts` also blocks `/profile`, `/favorites`, `/reviews`, `/trips` routes.

**What you're seeing:**
If you can access `/profile`, you're logged in (via Google OAuth). The page shows YOUR data, not generic placeholders.

**To test protection:**
1. Open incognito window
2. Go to `your-site.com/profile`
3. You'll be redirected to login ✅

## 📊 Activities Table Structure Issue

**Problem:** Activities are split across multiple Airtable tables:
- `Activities` (general)
- `Rainy Activities`
- `Sunny Activities`

**Solution:** The CSV provides a **unified structure**. You have two options:

### Option A: Single Unified Table (Recommended)
1. Create new Airtable table: `All_Activities`
2. Import the CSV
3. Add more activities (use same structure)
4. Update website to read from one table
5. Use `category` field to filter (Beach, Hiking, etc.)
6. Use `weatherPreferences` field instead of separate tables

**Benefits:**
- ✅ Easier to manage
- ✅ No duplicate entries
- ✅ Consistent fields
- ✅ Better for search/filtering

### Option B: Keep Separate Tables
1. Import CSV activities to appropriate existing tables
2. Ensure all tables have same field structure
3. Website queries multiple tables and combines results

**Recommendation: Option A** - Much easier long-term!

## 📥 How to Import to Airtable

### Step 1: Prepare Airtable

3. Airtable will auto-detect fields from CSV

### Step 2: Import CSV

2. Upload `santa-cruz-all-activities.csv`

### Step 3: Configure Field Types
Airtable usually gets it right, but verify:
- `latitude`, `longitude` → Number (decimal)
- `cost` → Number
- `rating` → Number
- `kidFriendly`, `petFriendly`, `staffPick`, `featured` → Single select or Checkbox
- `tags`, `weatherPreferences` → Multiple select (comma separated)

## 🔄 Update Website to Use New Table

Once Airtable is set up, update your code:

### File: `src/lib/airtable.ts`
```typescript
// Add new environment variable
const ACTIVITIES_TABLE = process.env.AIRTABLE_ACTIVITIES_TABLE || 'All_Activities';

// Add function to get all activities
export async function getAllActivities(): Promise<Activity[]> {
  const records = await base(ACTIVITIES_TABLE)
    .select({
      view: 'Grid view',
      sort: [{ field: 'name', direction: 'asc' }]
    })
    .all();

  return records.map(record => ({
    id: record.id,
    name: record.get('name') as string,
    description: record.get('description') as string,
    category: record.get('category') as string,
    // ... map all other fields
  }));

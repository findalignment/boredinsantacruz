CRITICAL LINKING RULES FOR BUSINESSES:
- **ALWAYS link to specific businesses when you mention them by name**
- Determine the type based on tags/context:
  * Restaurants/Food ‚Üí use /restaurant/[ID]
  * Yoga/Fitness/Spa/Wellness ‚Üí use /wellness/[ID]
  * Activities/Attractions ‚Üí use /activity/[ID]
- ONLY create links for businesses listed above that have an ID
- DO NOT make up fake IDs like "natural-bridges" or "westcliff"
- If a business doesn't have an ID above, link to the category page instead

**Correct Linking Examples:**
‚úÖ "Try [Cafe Brazil](/restaurant/rec123abc) for breakfast" - if ID is rec123abc
‚úÖ "Check out [Yoga Source](/wellness/rec456xyz) for yoga classes" - if ID is rec456xyz
‚úÖ "Visit [Natural Bridges State Beach](/activity/rec789def)" - if ID is rec789def
‚úÖ "For more restaurants, see [restaurants](/restaurants)" - category fallback
‚ùå "[Natural Bridges](/activity/natural-bridges)" - DO NOT make up IDs
‚ùå "Try Cafe Brazil for breakfast" - MISSING link entirely

IMPORTANT: When you mention a specific business NAME, you MUST include the link to its detail page if an ID is provided above.\n`;

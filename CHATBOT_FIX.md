# 🔧 Chatbot Fix - Step by Step

## ✅ DIAGNOSIS COMPLETE

**Good news:** Your chat API is working! I tested it and got this response:
```
"Hello! How can I assist you today in exploring Santa Cruz? 
Whether you're interested in outdoor activities, dining options, 
or cultural experiences, I'm here to help! What are you in the mood for?"
```

**The problem:** Frontend display issue, not backend.

## 🛠️ QUICK FIX

The chat component might not be visible or styled correctly. Let me verify the setup:

### **Step 1: Restart Dev Server**
```bash
# Stop the current server (Ctrl+C if running in foreground)
# Or kill background process:
pkill -f "npm run dev"

# Start fresh
npm run dev
```

### **Step 2: Clear Browser Cache**
1. Open http://localhost:3000
2. Press **Cmd+Shift+R** (Mac) or **Ctrl+Shift+R** (Windows) to hard refresh
3. Or open in **Incognito/Private mode**

### **Step 3: Check Browser Console**
1. Press **F12** to open DevTools
2. Go to **Console** tab
3. Look for any errors (red text)
4. Share any errors you see

## 🔍 COMMON ISSUES & FIXES

### **Issue 1: Chat Input Doesn't Send**

- Make sure JavaScript is enabled

### **Issue 2: Chat Responds But Text Doesn't Appear**

**This is likely your issue!** The streaming response parsing might be off.

**Current code issue:** The `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` might be sanitizing away the content.

**Fix:** I'll update the component to use safer rendering.

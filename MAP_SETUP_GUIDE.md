# Map Setup Guide

## üó∫Ô∏è The Map Page Not Loading?

The interactive map requires a **Mapbox API token** to function. The page is accessible at `/map` but will show a configuration message until you add the token.

## Quick Fix (3 Steps)

### Step 1: Get Your Mapbox Token

1. Go to [https://www.mapbox.com/](https://www.mapbox.com/)
2. Sign up for a free account (or log in)
3. Navigate to **Account ‚Üí Tokens**
4. Copy your **Default Public Token** (or create a new one)

**Free Tier Includes:**
- 50,000 free map loads per month
- Perfect for most small-to-medium sites

### Step 2: Add Token to `.env.local`

Add this line to your `.env.local` file:

```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_MAPBOX_ACCESS_TOKEN=pk.your_token_here
```

**‚ö†Ô∏è Important:** The variable **MUST** start with `NEXT_PUBLIC_` to work in the browser.

### Step 3: Restart Your Server

```bash
# Stop server (Ctrl+C)

# Restart:
npm run dev
```

**That's it!** Visit `/map` to see the interactive map.

## What the Map Shows

‚úÖ **All activities** from your Airtable database  
‚úÖ **Color-coded markers** by activity type  
‚úÖ **Interactive popups** with activity details  
‚úÖ **Filters** for location, cuisine, price, and more  
‚úÖ **Geolocation** - Find activities near you  

---

## Troubleshooting

### "Map not loading"
- ‚úÖ Check token starts with `NEXT_PUBLIC_`
- ‚úÖ Restart server after adding token
- ‚úÖ Clear browser cache (Cmd+Shift+R / Ctrl+Shift+R)
- ‚úÖ Check browser console for errors (F12)

### "Invalid token" error
- ‚úÖ Make sure you copied the full token (starts with `pk.`)
- ‚úÖ No quotes around the token in `.env.local`
- ‚úÖ No spaces before or after the `=`

### "Markers not showing"
- ‚úÖ Check that activities have valid addresses in Airtable
- ‚úÖ Map uses known coordinates or geocodes addresses
- ‚úÖ Some activities may not have mappable locations

Users can still access it via:
- ‚úÖ Direct URL: `/map`
- ‚úÖ Chatbot recommendations (when appropriate)
- ‚úÖ Restaurant & activity detail pages may link to map view

## Alternative: Remove Map Page

If you don't want to use Mapbox, you can remove the map page entirely:

```bash
# Delete the map page
rm src/app/map/page.tsx

# Or just keep it - it shows a nice "configure me" message
```

The map is **optional** - your site works perfectly without it!
